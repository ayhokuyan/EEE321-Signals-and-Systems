## Coverage of the repository

### Lab 1
- Apply quantization to cosine signals and observe fundamental frequencies. 
- Prove Nyquist criterion. 
- Implemented in MATLAB

### Lab 2
- Explore the linearity and causality of a given system. 
- Implement convolution and convolve the given inputs with the system(s). 
- Implemented in MATLAB

### Lab 3
- Discretize a continuous function and analytically find its Fourier series expansion.
- Plot the spectrum. 
- Recreate the signal using its Fourier series components. plot the results.
- Repeat the experiment for various N values and systems. 
- Implemented in MATLAB

### Lab 4
- Investigate given FIR (Finite Impulse Response) filters, find the magnitude and phase of their frequency responses. 
- Pass the given inputs through the filter analytically and with MATLAB, discuss the results, comment on frequency selectivity. 
- Implemented in MATLAB

### Lab 5
- Design a band-pass FIR filter with the given parameters and experiment on MATLAB its response to the input music. 
- Implemented in MATLAB

### Lab 6
- Design a band-pass IIR filter. 
- Implemented in MATLAB
